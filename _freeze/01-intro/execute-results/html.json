The continent experiences some of the most pronounced hydrological variability on Earth: years of crippling drought give way to sudden, widespread flooding, driven by large-scale climate oscillations including the El Nino-Southern Oscillation and the Indian Ocean Dipole. For any predictive model, this variability is not background noise to be absorbed but a central structural feature to be represented.\n\nThe core challenge is that precipitation data violates the assumptions of standard regression in three simultaneous ways, each of which requires a distinct methodological response. This report develops a framework that addresses all three, building from first principles through empirical analysis to a validated hierarchical model.\n\n## Why Standard Models Fail\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Three Structural Violations in Australian Rainfall Data\n\n**Zero-inflation.** Approximately 64% of daily observations record exactly zero rainfall. A Gaussian linear model fitted to this data is forced to place probability mass on negative values in order to fit the bulk of the distribution correctly, producing predictions that are physically impossible. This is not a problem of outliers or transformations; it is a consequence of the data-generating process having two qualitatively different states.\n\n**Heavy right tail.** When rain does fall, the distribution of daily amounts is severely right-skewed, with a kurtosis of 181 and a maximum recorded value of 371 mm. The variance is approximately sixteen times the square of the mean. Standard models that assume a symmetric or light-tailed error distribution will systematically underestimate both the probability and the magnitude of extreme events.\n\n**Temporal dependence.** Daily observations are not independent. Whether it rained yesterday is one of the strongest predictors of whether it will rain today, with a transition probability of 47% from wet to wet compared to only 15% from dry to wet. Any model that treats consecutive observations as exchangeable ignores a substantial and recoverable source of predictive information.\n:::\n\nEach of these violations is not merely a statistical inconvenience. Each reflects a physical property of the atmosphere: the discrete threshold between no-precipitation and precipitation conditions, the stochastic intensity of convective and frontal systems once that threshold is crossed, and the temporal persistence of synoptic weather regimes. A model that ignores these properties is not a simplification of the problem; it is a misspecification of it.\n\n## The Modelling Framework\n\nThis analysis uses a **Zero-Inflated Gamma (ZIG)** hierarchical model. The core innovation is to treat rainfall occurrence and rainfall intensity as two distinct sub-problems with separate linear predictors, linked through a shared observation mechanism.\n\nThe formal structure is as follows. For each observation $i$, the model defines:\n\n$$P(Y_i = 0) = \\pi_i + (1 - \\pi_i) \\cdot f_\\Gamma(0 \\mid \\mu_i, \\phi)$$\n\n$$P(Y_i = y) = (1 - \\pi_i) \\cdot f_\\Gamma(y \\mid \\mu_i, \\phi), \\quad y > 0$$\n\nwhere $\\pi_i = \\text{logit}^{-1}(\\mathbf{z}_i^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\gamma})$ governs the probability of a structurally dry day, and $\\mu_i = \\exp(\\mathbf{x}_i^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\beta})$ governs the expected intensity given that rain falls. The two predictor vectors $\\mathbf{z}_i$ and $\\mathbf{x}_i$ are estimated separately, allowing the atmospheric conditions that trigger rain to differ from those that determine how much falls.\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n## Why Not Tweedie?\nThe Tweedie distribution is a natural alternative for zero-inflated positive continuous data, using a compound Poisson-Gamma structure to accommodate zero values alongside a continuous positive component. It was evaluated here and rejected on empirical grounds. The exploratory analysis (see @sec-eda) demonstrates that the predictors of occurrence and the predictors of intensity are not the same: `rain_yesterday` and `pressure_change` operate primarily through the hurdle component, while wind vectors and the sunshine-humidity interaction drive the conditional intensity. A Tweedie model constrains both to share a single linear predictor, obscuring this physical distinction and reducing interpretability without improving fit.\n:::\n\n## Report Structure\n\nThis document is organised as a progressive validation of modelling choices, beginning with data quality and proceeding through feature design, model construction, diagnostic testing, and formal selection.

We implement a two-stage imputation strategy that combines linear temporal interpolation with multivariate Random Forest imputation via `mice`, using physically motivated predictor sets for each variable to fill these gaps while preserving both sample size and predictive signal.\n\n**Represent weather dynamics as continuous physical processes.** Wind direction is circular, the annual cycle is periodic, and the joint effect of humidity and sunshine is non-linear. Standard encodings of these variables discard their structural properties. We develop features that preserve this geometry: orthogonal vector decomposition for wind direction, sine-cosine encoding for seasonality, and a mean-centred multiplicative term for the humidity-sunshine interaction.\n\n**Account for spatial heterogeneity.** The relationship between atmospheric conditions and rainfall is not uniform across a continent as climatologically diverse as Australia. We introduce location-specific random effects that allow baseline rainfall levels and key covariate relationships to vary by station, without requiring a separate model for each location.\n\n**Validate against the data-generating process, not just the mean.** Standard accuracy metrics measure proximity to the observed mean but cannot detect distributional misspecification. We use simulation-based residual diagnostics to verify that the model replicates the full statistical distribution of Australian rainfall, including its zero-inflation rate, tail behaviour, and temporal independence structure.\n",
